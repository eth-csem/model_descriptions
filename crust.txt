The implementation of the crust is based on the global-scale surface wave inversion by Meier et al. (2007a,b). S velocity is scaled to P velocity and density, with slightly different scalings for oceanic and continental regions.

The handling of topography is not optimal at the moment. Topography is simply added to the crustal thickness.

Since the true crustal thickness is not known, a 25 % taper is applied, i.e. the crust is smeared into the mantle over a depth range that corresponds to 25 % of its local thickness.

Crustal anisotropy is a continuation of upper-mantle anisotropy, which increases linearly with increasing radius, starting at 180 km depth.
