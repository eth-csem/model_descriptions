The 1D background model is a variant of PREM with various features:

[1] The reference frequency is 1 Hz.
[2] The 220 km discontinuity has been replaced by a linear gradient.
[3] The P wave anisotropy has been removed, and eta has been set to 1.
[4] The S wave anisotropy increases linearly from 180 km depth upwards. It is zero below 180 km.
[5] Velocities in the upper mantle are slightly adjusted, mostly based on the European inversion (Fichtner et al., 2013).
[6] Discontinuities in the upper-mantle Qmu model have also been replaced by linear gradients, to avoid discontinuities in velocities at other frequencies.
[7] The crust has been removed, as it will be replaced by a crustal model anyway.

Much of this 1D model is the result of the Europe inversion (Fichtner at al. 2013). Subsequent adjustments were made based on the first global simulations.
