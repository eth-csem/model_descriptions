Initial global-scale perturbations are derived from S20RTS (Ritsema et al., 1999). From the S velocity perturbations, the P velocity perturbations are obtained by scaling, following Ritsema & van Heijst (2002). The scaling factor R=dvs/dvp increases linearly with depth, from R=1.25 at the surface to R=3.00 at the core-mantle boundary.

To avoid gaps between the S20RTS perturbations and the crust, S20RTS is simply extended to the surface before the crust is added.

Density variations as well as anisotropy are ignored.
